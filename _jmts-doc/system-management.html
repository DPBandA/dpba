<h2>System Management</h2>
<p>
    The System Management module in JMTS provides centralized control over users, 
    roles, permissions, security policies, system settings, and administrative activity logs. 
    Designed for enterprise environments, it ensures secure access management, compliance, 
    and efficient governance across your ERP platform.

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>User</h3> 
<p>
    A User is an authorized individual who has been granted access to the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS). 
    Each user is assigned specific roles and privileges that determine what actions 
    they can perform and which modules or data they can access within the system. 
    Users may include administrators, managers, staff members, or other stakeholders 
    who interact with JMTS to carry out organizational tasks.
</p>

<h3>Module</h3>
<p>
    A Module is a distinct functional component of the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS) 
    designed to manage a specific area of business operations. Each module contains 
    related features, workflows, data structures, and privileges that support a particular 
    function, such as client management, financial management, human resource management, 
    reporting, or system administration. Modules work together within the JMTS framework to 
    provide an integrated and scalable Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.
</p>

<h3>Privilege</h3>
<p>
    A Privilege is a defined system authorization that grants a User permission to 
    perform a specific action or access a particular resource within the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS). 
    Privileges control what users can view, create, modify, approve, or delete across modules. 
    By assigning privileges to roles and users, JMTS enforces security, accountability, 
    and proper separation of duties within the organization.
</p>

    <strong>authorized user</strong> by doing the following:
