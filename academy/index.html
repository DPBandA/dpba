        In metrology, measurement uncertainty is the expression of the statistical 
        dispersion of the values attributed to a measured quantity. All measurements 
        are subject to uncertainty and a measurement result is complete only when 
        it is accompanied by a statement of the associated uncertainty, such as 
        the standard deviation. This course aims to teach you the basics of measurement 
        uncertainty and to get you started in determining, interpreting and applying 
        measurement uncertainty statements.
