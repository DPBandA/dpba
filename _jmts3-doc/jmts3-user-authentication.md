# User Authentication

A person who intends to use the the JMTS must be authenticated and become an **authorized user** by doing the following:

1.	Open a browser then enter the JMTS address (e.g. http://localhost/jmts) into the address field of the browser.
2.	When the Login Dialog appears, type a valid username and password then press the Login button as shown in the Figure 1 below.
3.	A person whose login attempt is validated will be directed to their 'Home' page of the JMTS.
