<p>
    Job Management and Tracking System (JMTS) is a web based enterprise application 
    that is used to facilitate the processes of recording, editing, viewing, reporting 
    and tracking data for any job undertaken by an organization. 
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Required field</h3>
<p>
    This is the term used to refer to any form field which must be filled out with 
    data and should never be left blank. The field label for these fields are shown in bold font.
</p>

<h3>Authorized User</h3>
<p>
    This is the term used to describe an entity that is permitted to log into JMTS 
    with a valid username and password.
</p>

<h3>Job</h3>
<p>
    A job refers to any official task that an individual undertakes on behalf of 
    his/her organization.
</p>

<h3>Job Entry</h3>
<p>
    This is the term used to refer to a combination of data that is saved in JMTS 
    and represent only one job. Each job entry is uniquely identified by a specially 
    generated code called a Job Number. However, it is possible for an authorized 
    user to enter a Job Number in any format.
</p>

<h3>Job Sample</h3>
<p>
    A Job Sample refers to data entered into JMTS for each sample of product(s) 
    associated with a job.
</p>

<h2>User Authentication</h2>
<p>
    A person who intends to use JMTS must be authenticated and become an 
    <strong>authorized user</strong> by doing the following:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">

        1. Open a browser then enter JMTS address (e.g. http://localhost/jmts) 
        into the address field of the browser
    </li>
    <li>
        2. When the Login Dialog appears, type a valid username and password then 
        press the Login button as shown in the Figure 1 below
    </li>
    <li>
        3. A person whose login attempt is validated will be directed to their 
        'Home' page of JMTS
