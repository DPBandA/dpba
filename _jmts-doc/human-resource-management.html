<h2>Human Resource Management</h2>
<p>
    The Human Resource Management (HRM) module in the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS) 
    is designed to help organizations efficiently manage their workforce within a centralized 
    ERP platform. It provides structured tools for maintaining employee records, 
    monitoring attendance, managing leave, supporting payroll processes, and generating HR reports.

    Built with security and accountability in mind, the HRM module integrates seamlessly with 
    other JMTS modules to ensure accurate data flow across departments. Whether managing a 
    small team or a large enterprise workforce, the Human Resource Management module enables 
    streamlined operations, improved compliance, and informed decision-making.

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Employee</h3> 
<p>
    An Employee is an individual formally engaged by an organization to perform assigned 
    duties and responsibilities in exchange for compensation. Within the 
    Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS), an Employee is recorded in the Human Resource Management 
    module with relevant employment details such as position, department, employment status, 
    and service history. An employee may also be assigned system access as a User, depending 
    on their role and responsibilities within the organization.
</p>

<h3>Employment Position</h3>
<p>
    An Employment Position is a formally defined role within an organization that 
    outlines a specific set of duties, responsibilities, reporting relationships, 
    and required qualifications. In the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS), 
    an Employment Position is used within the Human Resource Management module to 
    classify employees according to their job function, organizational level, and 
    departmental assignment. Each Employment Position helps establish structure, 
    accountability, and alignment with the organization’s operational objectives.
</p>

<h3>Department</h3>
<p>
    A Department is a defined organizational unit within a company or institution 
    that is responsible for a specific function or area of operations. In the Job Management & Tracking System (JMTS), 
    a Department is used to group employees, assign responsibilities, and organize workflows 
    according to functional areas such as Finance, Human Resources, Operations, or Administration. 
    Departments support structured reporting lines, accountability, and efficient management 
    across the organization.
