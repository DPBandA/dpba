            in _Figure 1_.
        </li>
        2.	When the Job Detail GUI pops up, each required field, in the General tab of the interface, should be appropriately filled out.
        3.	If the job includes any sample(s), a sample entry should be made via the Samples tab of the interface by doing the following:
        a)	Click the New button in the Samples tab. 
        b)	When the â€˜Job Sampleâ€™ GUI pops up, fill out the relevant fields under both the â€˜Generalâ€™ tab.
        c)	Click the â€˜Okâ€™ button to complete the sample entry.
        4.	Select the â€˜Servicesâ€™ tab.
        5.	All the relevant tick boxes and or fields should be appropriately filled out and or ticked.
        6.	Select the â€˜Costing &amp; Paymentâ€™ tab.
        7.	All the relevant fields should be appropriately filled out.
        8.	Click the â€˜Saveâ€™ button to complete the job entry.
